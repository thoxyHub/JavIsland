# JavIsland

**JavIsland** is a wave-based 2D survival game developed in Java. It was created as a group project of five people for the Agile Object-Oriented Software Development course (02160) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The project showcases a modular architecture, clean coding practices, and iterative development.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project follows a clear **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:
- **Model**: Game logic and state (entities, map, items, etc.)
- **View**: Renders game and UI using observer pattern
- **Controller**: Handles player inputs and game updates

## ðŸ§° Troubleshooting

- **Missing maps**: Ensure `MapDesign1.txt` and `MapDesign2.txt` are in the working directory.
- **Sprites not showing**: Confirm `resources/` is included in the classpath.
- **IDE issues**: Refresh source paths and rebuild the project.
